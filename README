Image/WMF version 1.01
======================

The IMAGE::WMF module provides a means of generating Windows
metafile images on non-windows platforms.

It emulates the binary data structures produced by the Windows
GDI API and packs them into a binary image file.

As far as possible the GD-style API is re-created and code used to
generate png images using the GD module should run with very little
change to produce WMFs.

Note that WMF if a vector image, not a bitmap, so image scaling
is possible in rendering applications.
